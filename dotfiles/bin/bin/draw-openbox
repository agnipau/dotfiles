# Spawn terminals interactively by drawing them.
# Requires slop and a terminal emulator that can be launched with specified
# dimensions (geometry parameter) (I use xst, but URxvt works too).
# I tested this version and it works with openbox as long as you don't set this
# rule in ~/.config/openbox/rc.mxl: <application class="*">
#                                     <position force="yes">
#                                       <x>center</x>
#                                       <y>center</y>
#                                     </position>

# To get this values you need to make your terminal fullscreen and then divide

# changing your terminal borders and then again dividing your screen width by
# your new $(tput cols) or $COLUMNS output and the same with your screen height.
