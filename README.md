Please don't copy unless you know _exactly_ what you're copying.

This setup works with Termux!
Obviously stow directory named ...-termux instead of the ones that don't end with -termux.
By default Termux look is quite awful, you can use tct to set a better colorscheme and font.
Termux supports ligatures, so try a font with ligatures (fira-code, iosevka etc.).
